The Word Guessing Game is a Python program where the user guesses a randomly selected word letter by letter. The user has as many turns as the word's length. If the guessed letter is in the word, it replaces an underscore in the word's placeholder. The game tracks the user's turns and the word's status. If the user guesses the word, they win and the game ends. If they can't guess it, they lose and the game ends. This game is a fun way to improve vocabulary and spelling.
